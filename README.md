# 🤖 Machine Learning ChatBot

This is a simple yet powerful chatbot built using Machine Learning. It uses **TF-IDF vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** to classify user inputs into predefined intents and respond accordingly. The bot is trained using a custom `Intent.json` file containing sample phrases and their corresponding response tags.
